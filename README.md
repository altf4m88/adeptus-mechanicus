"Adeptus mechanicus" was initially planned as the technical analysis bot for a much larger Cryptocurrency trading bot that utilizes AI to take perpetual trading decision.
The duty of this mechanicus is to do technical analysis in multiple prospective crypto coins, to check it's chart direction and finally presents a decision, whether to open LONG, SHORT or just hold the position.

I was a bit naive about this, the market is a chaos waste so wild so untameable and so uncontrollable. It's a futility to police the unpoliceable.
